        <h1>Major changes in Manulex_Infra version 2</h1>
      </titrepage>
      <p>• Separate G-Ph and Ph-G segmentations. In version 1 of Manulex_Infra,
        the description of the grapho-phonological associations was mainly
        thought in the reading direction, from grapheme to phoneme. The same
        associations were then used to analyze the associations between phonemes
        and graphemes (writing direction). However, this procedure causes
        problems especially -though not exclusively- when the words include
        silent letters. It should be remembered that the notion of consistency
        refers, in the case of Ph-G associations, to the probability of
        producing a particular grapheme from a given phoneme. When the phoneme
        is said to be 'silent' (silent letter), the speech signal cannot lead to
        the production of a silent letter and the descriptions of the
        associations must therefore be distinguished according to whether we are
        considering reading (G-Ph) or spelling (Ph-G). This is done in version 2
        (see tab 'Understanding Manulex_Infra).<br>
        <br>
        • Version 2 includes additional analyses on the consistency and the
        frequency of grapho-phonological associations on the final rime unit of
        words<br>
        <br>
        • Additional analyses restricted to lexical forms corresponding to
        lexemes (lemmas), thus excluding inflected forms (see tab 'Understanding
        Manulex_Infra')<br>
        <br>
        • For each word, the least consistent G-Ph or Ph-G association, and of
        the least frequent association are mentioned. Note that the least
        consistent association is not necessarily the least frequent
        association, and vice-versa. <br>
        <br>
        • Modifications/corrections of several phonological codes, graphemic and
        phonological segmentations<br>
        <br>
        • Removal of the distinction between the two 'a's (/a/ of 'patte' and
        /ɑ/ of 'pâte') when computing G-Ph consistency<br>
        <br>
        • Words including the grapheme 'ai' (e. g., 'maison', 'lainage') can
        frequently be pronounced with the phoneme /E/ or the phoneme /e/. The
        consistency of the G-Ph association no longer takes this distinction
        into account. <br>
        <br>
        • Introduction of the distinctions between the 'e' grapheme when
        obligatorily pronounced (compulsory schwa), always silent, or
        corresponding to an optional schwa (see 'phonetic codes' tab) <br>
        <br>
        • Modifications of the syllabic segmentation of words in accordance with
        the coding of the ‘e’ as silent/optional or corresponding to a
        compulsory schwa <br>
        <br>
        • The G-Ph consistency for 'e' with optional schwa ('reste', 'perle') is
        set to 100 since the 'e' may or may not be pronounced. <br>
        <br>
        • In the case of Ph-G associations, the silent letters in internal
        position (e.g. 'm' in 'autumn', 'p' in 'baptism') are not predictable
        from the speech signal, and the Ph-G consistency is therefore set to
        zero<br>
        <br>
        • Case of 'e' followed by two identical consonants. In version 1 of
        Manulex_infra, the orthographic sequences 'emm' and 'enn' were coded as
        graphemic groups whereas the 'e' followed by other doublets ('err',
        'ett') were coded separately from the consonants that follow (for
        example 'e.rr' in 'terre'). This particular coding of 'emm' and 'enn'
        satisfied the segmentation principle aimed at highlighting
        inconsistencies in word pronunciation, as these two orthographic
        sequences were pronounced differently in 'antenne' and 'flemme' than in
        'solennel' and 'patiemment'. However, given the high number of adverbs
        in 'emment' sharing the 'emm'-/am/ association (patiemment, évidemment,
        récemment), a word like 'femme' was coded as consistent. In version 2 of
        the database, the coding is standardized by marking the 'e' when
        followed by two identical consonants. For exemple, the word 'femme' is
        now coded as 'f.e[CC].mm.e' (with CC to indicate 2 identical
        consonants). Its low consistency results from the fact that 'e' followed
        by a doublet is usually pronounced /e/ or /E/. This coding is only
        realized for G-Ph associations, not for Ph-G associations, since in
        French, the presence of a doublet in not cued in the speech signal. <br>
        <br>
        • Case of words including -eill or -eil not preceded by 'u' (e. g.,
        'abeille', 'bienveillant', 'sommeil'). The coding has been modified in
        'eil' or 'eill'. In these groups the sequence 'ill' is always associated
        with the semi-vowel /j/, never with the consonant /l/<br>
        <br>
        • The finals of verbs in -ent are, in the reading direction (G-Ph),
        segmented 'en.t' in the version 2 of Manulex-infra. This segmentation is
        comparable to that of the forms in '-ant', '-ont', '-ons', ..., (an .t,
        on.t, on.s) <br>
        <br>
        • In order to eliminate some rare G-Ph or Ph-G associations, proper
        names are excluded from the analyses. </p>
