        <h1>Main changes in Manulex_Infra version 2</h1>
      </titrepage>
      <p>• Separate G-Ph and Ph-G segmentations. In version 1 of <i>Manulex-infra</i>,
        the description of the grapho-phonological associations was mainly
        thought in the reading direction, from grapheme to phoneme. The same
        associations were then used to analyze the associations between phonemes
        and graphemes (writing direction). However, this procedure causes
        problems especially -though not exclusively- when the words include
        silent letters. Indeed, Ph-G consistency is defined as the probability
        of writing a particular grapheme from the pronounced phoneme. In the
        case of a silent grapheme, no audible phoneme is produced and it is
        difficult to predict for sure what letter should be written (unless one
        knows the exact spelling of the word). Therefore associations must be
        described differently when considering reading (G-Ph) and writing
        (Ph-G). This information is now available in version 2 (see tab
        'Understanding Manulex_Infra)..<br>
        <br>
        • Analyses of the consistency and frequency of grapho-phonological
        associations on the final rhyme unit of words.<br>
        <br>
        • Analyses of lexemes (lemmas)<br>
        <br>
        • For each word the least consistent and the least frequent G-Ph or Ph-G
        association. Note that the least consistent association is not always
        the least frequent, and vice-versa. <br>
        <br>
        • Phonological codes and segmentations into graphemes and phonemes were
        modified<br>
        <br>
        • The distinction between the two 'a' (/a/ of 'patte' and /ɑ/ of 'pâte')
        were removed from consistency calculation. They are considered as the
        same phoneme.<br>
        <br>
        • Words including the grapheme 'ai' ('maison', 'laine') can be
        transcribed as /E/ or /e/. Therefore consistency calculation consider
        the G-Ph association as the same. <br>
        <br>
        • The difference between the 'e' that are obligatorily pronounced,
        obligatorily silent, or with optional schwa (see 'phonetic codes' tab)
        is now included in the analyses. <br>
        <br>
        • The syllabic segmentation of words in accordance with the coding of
        silent or non silent 'e' is included in the analyses.<br>
        <br>
        • The G-Ph consistency for the grapheme 'e' whose schwa is optional
        ('gare', 'parle') is set to 100 since the 'e' may or may not be
        pronounced. <br>
        <br>
        • In the case of Ph-G associations only, the few rare silent consonants
        in internal position (e.g. 'm' in 'automne', 'p' in 'baptême') are not
        present in the speech signal, and their Ph-G consistency is therefore
        0%.<br>
        <br>
        • Case of 'e' followed by two identical consonants. In version 1 of
        Manulex_infra, the orthographic sequences 'emm' and 'enn' were coded as
        one single graphemic group while the 'e' followed by other doublets
        ('err', 'ett') were coded as two (e.g. 'e.rr' in 'terre'). The coding of
        'emm' and 'enn' responded to the segmentation principle aimed at
        highlighting inconsistencies in word pronunciation, as these two
        orthographic sequences were pronounced differently in 'antenne' and
        'flemme' than in 'solennel' and 'patiemment'. However, given the high
        number of adverbs in '-emment' sharing the association 'emm'-/am/
        (patiemment, évidemment, récemment), a word like “femme” was described
        as consistent. The coding for reading was standardized by sorting 'e'
        when followed by two identical consonants as .e[CC]. (with CC to
        indicate 2 identical consonants) so the word 'femme' is now coded as
        'f.e[CC].mm.e'. This change in coding now describes the word “femme”
        with a low consistency score because 'e' followed by a doublet is
        usually pronounced /e/ or /E/. This coding of 'e[CC]' only occurs for
        G-Ph associations but not for Ph-G associations since, in French,
        nothing signals the presence of the doublet when words are pronounced
        orally. This coding of G-Ph associations with 'e[CC]' applies to all
        words in order to highlight inconsistencies, thus also to words such as
        'ennui' coded 'e[CC]-@.nn-n.u-8.i-i'. <br>
        <br>
        • Coding has been modified when -eill or -eil are not preceded by 'u'
        ('abeille', 'bienveillant', 'sommeil'). 'eil' and 'eill' are now
        a single block where 'ill' is always associated with the
        semi-vowel /j/, never with the consonant /l/.<br>
        <br>
        • Verb endings in -ent are, when reading is considered (G-Ph), segmented
        'en.t'. It is comparable to the description of verb endings in '-ant',
        '-ont', '-ons', ..., (an .t, on.t, on.s). <br>
        <br>
        • In order to eliminate some rare G-Ph or Ph-G associations, proper
        names are excluded from the analyses.
