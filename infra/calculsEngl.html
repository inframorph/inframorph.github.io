      <p><b>Consistency and Frequency of the grapho-phonological associations :</b>
        The ambiguity of phonological coding from orthographic input, and the
        ambiguity of spelling from phonological input, are generally estimated
        by consistency index. In alphabetic scripts, consistency of the
        grapheme-phoneme (G-Ph) and phoneme-grapheme (Ph-G) associations is a
        critical factor in learning to read and write. The term "grapheme" is
        used here to refer to letter or letter groups that match a phoneme. Note
        that French includes several multi-letter graphemes such as "ou", "an",
        "un", "in", "eu", "ch", and "gn". The G-Ph consistency index is equal to
        the frequency at which a particular grapheme-phoneme mapping occurs
        divided by the total frequency of the grapheme, no matter how it is
        pronounced. The consistency of a G-Ph association thus reflects the
        probability of associating a particular phoneme with a given grapheme.
        For example, the G-Ph consistency index of the association "ch"-&gt;/S/
        (as in the word "chat" /Sa/) is obtained by dividing the frequency of
        occurrence of the "ch"-&gt;/S/ association by the frequency of the
        grapheme "ch", irrespective of its pronunciation (including /S/, but
        also /k/ for example, as in "choral" /koRal/). The G-Ph consistency
        index is then multiplied by 100. Its maximal value is 100. Similarly,
        the Ph-G consistency index is equal to the frequency at which a
        particular phoneme-grapheme mapping occurs, divided by the total
        frequency of the phoneme multiplied by 100, no matter how the phoneme is
        spelled.</p>
      <p>Consistency can differ greatly depending on the serial position of the
        grapheme or phoneme in the word. In particular, due to the derivational
        morphology of French, word endings are often silent, so spelling is less
        transparent. Thus, to better characterize the orthography-phonology
        mappings of French, frequency and consistency were computed as a
        function of the relative serial position: initial (first
        grapheme/phoneme), final (last grapheme/phoneme), and intermediate
        (graphemes/phonemes in the middle of words). <i>Manulex_infra</i> also
        provides two types of mean consistency and frequency: one lexical and
        the other textual. The lexical frequency (i.e. Count by-type) reflects
        the number of different words in the database that include a G-Ph and
        Ph-G correspondences, whereby each word is only counted once. Text
        frequency (i.e. Count by-token) reflects the number of words (different
        or identical) in the texts that include a correspondence of interest,
        whereby a word is counted as often as it appears in the corpus. So,
        frequency and consistency values of the G-Ph and Ph-G mappings are
        independent of the frequency of occurrence of words in the texts (rare
        or frequent words) in the by-type statistics, while the frequency and
        consistency values are weighted by the frequency of word occurrence in
        the by-token statistics. </p>
      <p>Graphemic segmentation of French words is generally not problematic,
        although segmentation choices had to be made in some cases. As far as
        possible, the main principle was to segment the orthographic chains so
        that each segmented substring corresponds to a single phoneme. Our
        choices were governed by a second important principle according to which
        segmentation must highlight inconsistencies in the
        pronunciation/spelling of the words. </p>
      <p>The presence of silent letters at the end of many words leads to
        different approaches for the analysis of G-Ph associations and the
        analysis of Ph-G associations. In the reading direction, G-Ph mappings
        involving silent graphemes can be described as the association between a
        grapheme and a silent 'phoneme' (e.g., 'd' in 'lourd', 'p' in 'loup',
        the gender inflection 'e' in 'amie', the number inflection 's' in
        'tables'). For example, the final G-Ph association of the word 'nid'
        ending with a silent 'd' is strongly consistent because the final 'd' is
        rarely pronounced in French words. Conversely, the final 'd' in the word
        'sud' is pronounced, and the consistency of the mapping between the
        grapheme 'd' and the phoneme /d/ is low. The presence of silent letters
        at the end of words must be considered differently when analyzing
        phoneme-to-grapheme associations (Ph-G; writing direction) because the
        graphemes are silent (e.g., /fulaR/ for the word "foulard" ending with
        the silent letter "d"). The solution adopted in <i>Manulex-Infra v.2</i>
        is to group the final silent letters with the last pronounced grapheme
        (last phoneme). For example, in the writing direction, the final of the
        word "renard" is coded /R/-rd, the word "terre" /R/-rre, and the word
        "gare" /R/-re (the pronunciation of "renard" is thus compatible with
        misspellings such as "renarre", or "renare"). The coding principle is
        similar when the last phoneme is a vowel; "jamais" is coded /E/-ais, and
        "lait" /E/-ait. </p>
      <p><b>Rime context.</b> Grapho-phonological associatiations for word
        endings are also considered in the larger context of the phonological
        rime. These complementary analyses also address the observation that, in
        spelling production, orthographic choices are partly determined by the
        rime context. In this case, a silent grapheme such as 'd' in the word
        'renard' is no longer integrated into the Ph-G association /R/-'rd' but
        into the final rime of the word, /aR/-'ard'. The phonological rime, as
        considered in version 2 of <i>Manulex-infra</i>, corresponds to the
        last vowel of the word, different from a schwa, the eventual semi-vowels
        which precede it, and the eventual semi-vowels, consonants or schwa
        which follow it. For example "ion-/jɔ͂/" in "nation", "illard-/jaR/" in
        "billiard". The semi-vowel that precedes the vowel is considered as part
        of the rime because spelling variability depends on whether the
        semi-vowel is taken into account or not. For example, for nouns, the
        final /ɔ͂/ ('on') can be spelled in many ways (on, ond, om, ont, onc,
        omb, ong), whereas in /jɔ͂/, the 'on' is not followed by silent
        consonants (ion, yon, illon in nation, rayon, bouillon). As with for the
        G-Ph and Ph-G associations, both consistency and frequency of the rime
        associations must be considered when evaluating word spelling
        difficulties. A highly consistent but rare association is a source of
        difficulties.To determine how difficult a word is to read or spell,
        consider its consistency not only on the final rime, but also on the
        G-Ph or Ph-G associations. Words can be highly consistent on rimes but
        inconsistent on G-Ph or Ph-G associations. </p>
      <p><b>Analyses including or not the inflected (gender, number) and
          conjugated forms of verbs.</b> The grapho-phonological relations
        (consistency and frequency G-Ph, Ph-G, rhyme) are analyzed either by
        including all the orthographic forms encountered in the textbooks, or by
        taking into account only the orthographic forms that correspond to the
        associated lemma (or lexeme). This second analysis allows a description
        of the grapho-phonological associations by excluding the variations
        related to gender (masculine, feminine) and number (singular, plural)
        inflections, as well as to verbal inflections. Note that words that
        appear in textbooks only in the inflected form are not taken into
        account in the second analysis since the simple form is not encountered
        by the child. </p>
      <p><b>Other variables coded in <i>Manulex_Infra v.2</i></b> The <i>Manulex_Infra
          v.2</i> database provides additional information on lexical entries (a
        more detailed description is given under the 'download' tab):<br>
        • Least consistent or least frequent G-Ph or Ph-G association of the
        word (the association is provided along with the consistency or
        frequency values)<br>
        • Orthographic, phonological, graphemic, and syllabic length of the word<br>
        • Textbook word frequency at grade 1, grade 2, and grade 1 to grade 5
        according to the Manulex database<br>
        • Syllabic segmentation of the phonological code, G-Ph and Ph-G
        segmentations, phonological rime (and its orthographic counterpart)<br>
        • Orthographic neighborhood according to the 'n-count' index or the
        'Levenshtein distance' index. The n-count index counts the number of
        words that can be generated from a target word by substituting a single
        letter by another letter (e.g., 'rire' has as orthographic neighbors
        'lire', 'rare', and 'rime'). The higher the value, the denser the
        orthographic neighborhood. The Levenhstein distance (OLD20) corresponds
        to the average number of orthographic changes to be made to a word
        (letter substitution, letter transposition, letter deletion or addition)
        in order to generate its 20 closest orthographic neighbors. The lower
        the value, the denser the orthographic neighborhood.<br>
        • Number of non-homograph homophones (e.g., port-porc-pore) for
        adjectives and nouns.<br>
        • Average frequency of bigrams </p>
