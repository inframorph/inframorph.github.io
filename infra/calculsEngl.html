              <p><b>Consistency and Frequency of the grapho-phonological
                  associations :</b> The predictability of a word’s
                pronunciation or spelling from grapheme-phoneme (G-Ph) or
                phoneme-grapheme (Ph-G) associations is typically estimated by a
                consistency index. The consistency of G-Ph and Ph-G associations
                is a critical factor in learning to read and write in an
                alphabetical script. The term <i>grapheme</i> refers to a
                letter or a group of letters that corresponds to a phoneme. In
                French, graphemes include groups of letters such as 'ou', 'an',
                'un', 'in',&nbsp; 'eu',&nbsp; 'ch', and 'gn'. The G-Ph
                consistency index is equal to the frequency of occurrence of a
                particular G-Ph association in words, divided by the total
                frequency of the grapheme, regardless of its pronunciation. The
                consistency of a G-Ph association thus reflects the probability
                of associating a particular phoneme with a given grapheme. For
                example, the G-Ph consistency index of the association
                'ch'-&gt;/S/ (as in the word 'chat' /Sa/) is obtained by
                dividing the frequency of occurrence of the association
                'ch'-&gt;/S/ by the frequency of the grapheme 'ch', whatever its
                pronunciation (including /S/, but also /k/ for instance, as in
                'choral' /koRal/). The G-Ph consistency index is then multiplied
                by 100. Its maximum value is 100. Similarly, the Ph-G
                consistency index is equal to the frequency of occurrence of a
                particular phoneme-grapheme correspondence, divided by the total
                frequency of the phoneme multiplied by 100, regardless of the
                phoneme’s orthography..</p>
              <p>Consistency can vary considerably depending on a grapheme or a
                phoneme’s position within a word. Due to the evolution of
                inflectional and derivational morphology rules in French, word
                endings are often silent, which reduces their orthographic
                consistency. Thus, to better characterize grapheme-phoneme
                correspondences in the database, frequency and consistency were
                computed separately based on their position in words: initial
                (first grapheme/phoneme), final (last grapheme/phoneme), or
                intermediate (graphemes/phonemes in the middle of words). <i>Manulex_infra</i>
                also provides two types of consistency and frequency data: the
                lexical and the textual statistics. Lexical frequency (i.e.,
                count by type) reflects the number of different words in the
                database that include a G-Ph or Ph-G correspondence of interest
                while each word is counted only once. Textual frequency (i.e.
                count per token) reflects the number of words in the texts that
                include a correspondence while each word is counted as often as
                it appears in the corpus. Thus, the frequency and consistency
                values of the G-Ph and Ph-G correspondences do not account for
                the frequency of occurrence of words in the texts (rare or
                frequent words) when a count by type is considered, while the
                frequency and consistency values are weighted by the frequency
                of occurrence of words in a count by token. </p>
              <p>Graphemic segmentation of words tends to be easy in French. As
                far as possible, each segment matches a single phoneme. When
                word segmentation was ambiguous, the decision was based on a
                second principle that segmentation should highlight
                inconsistencies in each word’s pronunciation and writing.</p>
              <p> Silent letters at the end of many words required a different
                approach to analyse G-Ph associations and Ph-G associations. For
                example, the word “nid” ends with a silent 'd' and the final
                G-Ph is highly consistent when reading French, because 'd' in
                word final position is almost always silent. Conversely the
                final 'd' of the word 'sud' is pronounced, and the consistency
                of the rare G-Ph association 'd' -&gt; /d/ is low. When
                representing reading related statistics in <i>Manulex-infra</i>
                v.2, silent letters G-Ph are coded with the character '#' (e.g.,
                'd' in 'lourd', 'p' in 'loup', nominal gender inflection 'e' in
                'amie', nominal number inflection 's' in 'tables'). However,
                segmenting word final silent letters proceeded differently when
                spelling was considered, because silent letters are not
                pronounced and can therefore not be reported as standalone units
                (as in the word “foulard” pronounced /fulaR/ where the final 'd'
                is silent and cannot be matched to a phoneme). In this case, the
                final silent letters were merged with the last audible letter so
                that accurate statistics could be reported. For example, silent
                final ‘d’ in the word 'renard' is coded with the final ‘r’
                (/R/-rd), in the word 'terre' silent final ‘e’ is coded with the
                final 'rr' (/R/-rre), and in the word 'gare' silent final ‘e’ is
                coded with the&nbsp; final 'r' (/R/-re). The same logic was
                applied to coding other silent letters in words such as 'jamais'
                or 'lait' (/E/-ais, and /E/-ait respectively).</p>
              <p></p>
              <p><b>Final rime of words.</b> Additional analyses are provided by
                considering the broader contextual framework corresponding to
                phonological word finals. These additional analyses also respond
                to the observation that, in orthographic production,
                orthographic choices are partially a function of the rime
                context. In this case, a silent grapheme such as 'd' in the word
                'renard' is no longer integrated into the Ph-G association
                /R/-'rd' but as part of the final rime of the word /aR/-'ard'.
                In <i>Manulex-infra</i> v.2, the phonological rime is defined
                as the last vowel of the word (different from a schwa), the
                possible semi-vowels preceding it, and the possible semi-vowels,
                consonants, or schwa following it. Note that a semi-vowel placed
                before a vowel is part of the rime because the rime’s spelling
                pattern will partially depend on whether a semi-vowel is present
                or not. For example, nouns ending in /ɔ͂/ ('on') can be spelled
                in multiple ways (-on, -ons, -ond, -om, -ont, -onc, -omb,
                -ong...), whereas words ending in /jɔ͂/ are never spelled with a
                silent final consonants (-ion, -yon, -illon in 'nation',
                'rayon', 'bouillon'). Similarly, The rime /aR/ can be spelled in
                multiple ways (-ard, -art, -are, -ar, -arre, -ars) but paired
                with /w/, /aR/ can only be spelled -oir or -oire. </p>
              <p>Estimating the degree of difficulty of a word requires
                considering its consistency and frequency at the level of its
                final rime, but also at the level of G-Ph or Ph-G
                correspondences. Some words may be very consistent at the rime
                level but very inconsistent at the G-Ph or Ph-G level. For
                exemple, the word “femme” is very consistent when considering
                the rime but inconsistent when considering G-Ph or Ph-G
                associations.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p><b>Analyses including or excluding nominal gender and nominal
                  number inflections and verbs inflections.</b>
                Grapho-phonological relations (consistency and frequency G-Ph,
                Ph-G, rime) are analyzed either by including: <br>
                • all the orthographic forms encountered in the textbooks<br>
                • or the orthographic forms that correspond to the associated
                lemma (or lexeme) only. <br>
                This second analysis allows a description of grapho-phonological
                relations by excluding nominal gender and nominal number
                inflections (final -e for feminine), number forms (final -s or
                -x for plurial) and verbs inflections (person, tense, mode).
                Note that words that appear in schoolbooks in an inflected form
                only are not included in this second analysis, since this would
                mean that the simple, non-inflected form will not be encountered
                by children when reading print. </p>
              <p><b>Other variables coded in <i>Manulex_Infra v.2</i></b> The <i>Manulex_Infra
                  v.2</i> database provides additional information on the
                lexical entries (more detailed description under the 'download'
                tab):):<br>
                • Least consistent or least frequent G-Ph or Ph-G association of
                the word (the association is provided along with the consistency
                or frequency values)<br>
                • Orthographic, phonological, graphemic, and syllabic length of
                the word<br>
                • Textbook word frequency at grade 1, grade 2, and grade 1 to 5
                based on Manulex<br>
                • Syllabic segmentation of the phonological code<br>
                • G-Ph and Ph-G segmentation, phonological rime (and its
                orthographic equivalent)<br>
                • Orthographic neighborhood of the word according to the
                'n-count' index or the 'Levenshtein distance' index. The n-count
                index provides the number of words generated if any letter in a
                word is substituted with another one (e.g., 'rire' has as
                orthographic neighbors 'lire', 'rare', and 'rime'). The higher
                the value, the denser the orthographic neighborhood. The
                Levenhstein distance index (OLD20) provides the average number
                of orthographic modifications that need to occur in a word
                (letter substitution, letter transposition, letter deletion or
                addition) to generate 20 of its closest orthographic neighbors.
                The lower the value, the denser the orthographic neighborhood.<br>
                • Number of non-homograph homophones (e.g., port-porc-pore) for
                adjectives and nouns.<br>
