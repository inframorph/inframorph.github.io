      <p><b>Consistency and Frequency of the grapho-phonological associations :</b>
        The consistency index estimates to what extend the spelling of a word’s
        represents it’s phonological form and vice versa. The consistency of
        grapheme-phoneme (G-Ph) and phoneme-grapheme (Ph-G) associations is a
        critical factor in learning to read and write in an alphabetical script.
        The term "grapheme" is refers to a letter or a group of letters that
        corresponds to a phoneme. In French graphemes include groups of letters
        such as "ou," "an," "un," "in," "eu," "ch," and "gn." The G-Ph
        consistency index is equal to the frequency of occurrence of a
        particular G-Ph association in words, divided by the total frequency of
        the grapheme, regardless of its pronunciation. The consistency of a G-Ph
        association thus reflects the probability of associating a particular
        phoneme with a given grapheme. For example, the G-Ph consistency index
        of the association "ch"-&gt;/S/ (as in the word "chat” /Sa/) is obtained
        by dividing the frequency of occurrence of the association “ch”-&gt;/S/
        by the frequency of the grapheme “ch”, whatever its pronunciation
        (including /S/, but also /k/ for instance, as in “choral” /koRal/). The
        G-Ph consistency index is then multiplied by 100. Its maximum value is
        100. Similarly, the Ph-G consistency index is equal to the frequency of
        occurrence of a particular phoneme-grapheme correspondence, divided by
        the total frequency of the phoneme multiplied by 100, regardless of the
        phoneme’s orthography..</p>
      <p>Consistency can vary considerably depending on a grapheme or a
        phoneme’s position within a word. Due to the evolution of inflectional
        and derivational morphology rules in French, word endings are often
        silent, which reduces their orthographic consistency. Thus, to better
        characterize grapheme-phoneme correspondences in the database, frequency
        and consistency were computed separately based on their position in
        words: initial (first grapheme/phoneme), final (last grapheme/phoneme),
        or intermediate (graphemes/phonemes in the middle of words). <i>Manulex_infra</i>
        also provides two types of consistency and frequency data: the lexical
        and the textual statistics. Lexical frequency (i.e., count by type)
        reflects the number of different words in the database that include a
        G-Ph or Ph-G correspondance of interest while each word is counted only
        once. Textual frequency (i.e. count per token) reflects the number of
        words in the texts that include a correspondance while each word is
        counted as often as it appears in the corpus. Thus, the frequency and
        consistency values of the G-Ph and Ph-G correspondences do not account
        for the frequency of occurrence of words in the texts (rare or frequent
        words) when a count by type is considered, while the frequency and
        consistency values are weighted by the frequency of occurrence of words
        in a count by token. </p>
      <p>Segmenting words into grapheme tends to be easy in French. As far as
        possible, each segment matches a single phoneme. When word segmentation
        was ambiguous, the decision was based on a second important principle
        that segmentation should highlight inconsistencies in each word’s
        pronunciation and writing. This principle was applied to the silent
        letters at the end of words in French, which required that G-Ph and Ph-G
        be segmented differently in the database. For example, the word “nid”
        ends with a silent 'd' and the final G-Ph is highly consistent when
        reading French, because 'd' in word final position is almost always
        silent. Conversely the final 'd' of the word 'sud' is pronounced, and
        the consistency of the rare G-Ph for 'd' - /d/ is weak. When
        representing reading related statistics in <i>Manulex-infra</i> v.2,
        silent letters G-Ph are coded with the character '#' (e.g., 'd' in
        'lourd', 'p' in 'loup', gender inflection 'e' in 'amie', nomial number
        inflection 's' in 'tables'. However, segmenting word final silent
        letters proceeded differently when spelling was considered, because
        silent letters are not pronounced and can therefore not be reported as
        standalone units (as in the word “foulard” pronounced /fulaR/ where the
        final 'd' is silent and cannot be matched to a phoneme). In this case,
        Ph-G correspondences for final silent letters were merged with the last
        audible letter so that accurate statistics could be reported. For
        example, silent final ‘d’ in the word “renard” is coded with the final
        ‘r’ (/R/-rd), in the word “terre” silent final ‘e’ is coded with the
        final “rr” (/R/-rre), and in the word “gare” silent final ‘e’ is coded
        with the final is coded in the final “r” (/R/-re). The same logic was
        applied to coding other silent letters in words such as “jamais” or
        “lait” (/E/-ais, and /E/-ait respectively). </p>
      <p><b>Final rhyme of words.</b> Additional analyses are provided by
        considering the broader contextual framework corresponding to
        phonological word finals. These additional analyses also respond to the
        observation that, in orthographic production, orthographic choices are
        partially a function of the rhyme context. In this case, a silent
        grapheme such as 'd' in the word 'renard' is no longer integrated into
        the Ph-G association /R/-'rd' but as part of the final rhyme of the word
        /aR/-'ard'. In <i>Manulex-infra</i> v.2, the phonological rime is
        defined as the last vowel of the word (different from a schwa), the
        possible semi-vowels preceding it, and the possible semi-vowels,
        consonants, or schwa following it. Note that a semi-vowel placed before
        a vowel is part of the rhyme because the rhyme’s spelling pattern will
        partially depend on whether a semi-vowel is present or not. For example,
        nouns ending in /ɔ͂/ ('on') can be spelled in multiple ways (on, ons,
        ond, om, ont, onc, omb, ong...), whereas words ending in /jɔ͂/, the
        "'on"' are never spelled with a silent final consonants (ion, yon, illon
        in nation, rayon, bouillon). Similarly, The rime /aR/ can be spelled in
        multiple ways (ard, art, are, ar, arre, ars) but paired with /w/, /aR/
        can only be spelled -oir or -oire. </p>
      <p>Estimating the degree of difficulty of a word requires considering its
        consistency and frequency at the level of its final rhyme, but also at
        the level of G-Ph or Ph-G correspondences. Some words may be very
        consistent at the rhyme level but very inconsistent at the G-Ph or Ph-G
        level. It should be noted that words such as “femme” can be very
        consistent when considering the rime but inconsistent when considering
        G-Ph or Ph-G </p>
      <p></p>
      <p><b>Analyses including or excluding inflected nominal forms (gender,
          number) and verbs inflections.</b> Grapho-phonological relations
        (consistency and frequency G-Ph, Ph-G, rhyme) are analyzed by including
        either : <br>
        • all the orthographic forms encountered in the textbooks<br>
        • or the orthographic forms that correspond to the associated lemma (or
        lexeme) only. <br>
        This second analysis allows a description of grapho-phonological
        relations by excluding inflected nominal gender forms (masculine,
        feminine), number forms (singular, plural) and verbs inflections
        (person, tense, mode). Note that words that appear in schoolbooks in an
        inflected form only are not included in this second analysis, since this
        would mean that the simple, non-inflected form will not encountered by
        children when reading print. </p>
      <p><b>Other variables coded in <i>Manulex_Infra v.2</i></b> The <i>Manulex_Infra
          v.2</i> database database provides an additional information on the
        lexical entries it includes (more detailed description under the
        'download' tab):):<br>
        • Least consistent or least frequent G-Ph or Ph-G association of the
        word (the association is provided along with the consistency or
        frequency values)<br>
        • Orthographic, phonological, graphemic, and syllabic length of the word<br>
        • Textbook word frequency at grade 1, grade 2, and grade 1 to 5 based on
        Manulexe<br>
        • Syllabic segmentation of the phonological code<br>
        • G-Ph and Ph-G segmentation, phonological rhyme (and its orthographic
        equivalent)<br>
        • Orthographic neighborhood of the word according to the 'n-count' index
        or the 'Levenshtein distance' index. The n-count index provides the
        number of words generated if any letter in a word is substituted with
        another one (e.g., 'rire' has as orthographic neighbors 'lire', 'rare',
        and 'rime'). The higher the value, the denser the orthographic
        neighborhood. The Levenhstein distance index (OLD20) provides the
        average number of orthographic modifications that need to occur in a a
        word (letter substitution, letter transposition, letter deletion or
        addition) to generate 20 of its closest orthographic neighbors. The
        lower the value, the denser the orthographic neighborhood.<br>
        • Number of non-homograph homophones (e.g., port-porc-pore) for
        adjectives and nouns.<br>
        • Average frequency of bigrams (groups of two adjacent letters) </p>
