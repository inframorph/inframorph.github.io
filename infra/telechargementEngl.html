      <p> Two types of files (.xlsx format) are available for download (detailed
        description below): </p>
      <p><b>1. Lexical databases including the words and their characteristics
          (ver. 2.3).</b> The <a href="files/ManuAll-ver2.3.xlsx"><i>ManuAll </i></a>
        file contains all the lexical entries whereas the <a href="files/ManuLemme-ver2.3.xlsx"><i>ManuLemme
            </i></a> file contains only the orthographic forms corresponding to
        the lemmas. The grapho-phonological statistics of the words are
        independent. The ManuLemme file allows to characterize the
        grapho-phonological properties of words independently of gender/number
        inflections and verbal inflections.Note that words that appear in
        schoolbooks in an inflected form only are not included in this second
        analysis, since this would mean that the simple, non-inflected form will
        not be encountered by children when reading print. <br>
        <br>
        Filters are added at the top of the word lists to help selection <br>
        <br>
        <b>2. General statistics derived from the lexical databases.</b> Several
        files are available:<br>
        <br>
        • Consistency and frequency of G-Ph, Ph-G, and word rime associations.
        Statistics are generated from all lexical entries in the <a href="files/ManuAll-ver2.3-associations.xlsx"><i>ManuAll-Associations
            </i></a> file and from the lemmas in the <a href="files/ManuLemme-ver2.3-associations.xlsx"><i>ManuLemme-Associations
            </i></a> file. <br>
        <br>
        • Other orthographic statistics computed from the lexical corpus of
        ManuAll. These statistics, gathered in the file <a href="files/ManuAll-OrthoStat.xlsx"><i>ManuAll-OrthoStat
            </i></a>, are a) the frequency of letters and b) the frequency of
        bigrams and trigrams. These data are identical to those described in
        Manulex_Infra version 1.<br>
        <br>
        <i>Note: Google Sheets allows you to browse the files from your Google
          Drive. To import files directly into your Google Drive, use Chrome and
          the "Save to Google Drive" extension available on the Chrome Web
          Store. Then right-click on the file link to save it to your Google
          Drive</i> <br>
