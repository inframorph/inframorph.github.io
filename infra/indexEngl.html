        <h1>Manulex_infra v.2. - General description</h1>
      </titrepage>
      <p>The <i>Manulex_Infra</i> database provides several quantitative
        descriptions of the orthographic and grapho-phonological characteristics
        of French words encountered by children at the elementary school (Grade
        1-5). The corpus of words analyzed (nearly 45,000) and the word
        frequencies are taken from the Manulex database. <i>Manulex_Infra</i>
        (version 1) was initially published in 2007 (reference below) and made
        available for download at the University of Bourgogne (currently
        unavailable) and for online query on the Manulex.org website. The new
        version (v.2) of the database, available here for download, introduces a
        number of major changes which are detailed under the tab 'changes to
        version 1'. New information is also added to facilitate the selection of
        words according to their grapho-phonological characteristics. An online
        searchable version of the database will be developed as soon as possible</p>
      <p> The main statistical characteristics of the words analyzed in <i>Manulex_Infra</i>
        concern the relations between graphemes (G) and phonemes (Ph); the
        grapheme being considered as the orthographic counterpart of the phoneme
        (for example, 'ou' for /u/ in the word 'loup'; 'a' for /a/ in 'table').
        The associations are considered in the reading direction (from grapheme
        to phoneme) and in the writing direction (from phoneme to grapheme).
        Version 2 of <i>Manulex_Infra</i> also introduces an analysis of
        grapho-phonological associations based on larger units corresponding to
        the phonological rime of words. Another advantage of version 2 of
        Manulex_Infra is to analyze the grapho-phonological relations of words
        not only on the basis of the lexical forms encountered in the text
        corpus (as in version 1), but also according to the corresponding
        lexemes or lemmas. This second analysis allows a description of the
        grapho-phonological associations by excluding the variations related to
        gender (masculine, feminine) and number (singular, plural) inflections,
        as well as to verb tenses. </p>
      <p> A set of other characteristics are also described, such as word length
        indexes (letters, graphemes, syllables), word orthographic neighborhood
        ('n-count', Levenshtein distance), bigram and trigram frequencies,
        non-homographic homophones. A full description is provided under the tab
        'Understanding Manulex_Infra'. </p>
      <p> <i>The current version of the database is v.2. Several major changes
          have been made to the previous version. December 2021.<br>
