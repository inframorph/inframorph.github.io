        <h1>Manulex_Morpho v.2. - General description</h1>
      </titrepage>
      <p> <i>Manulex_morpho</i> provides information on the frequency and
        consistency of Grapheme-Phoneme (G-Ph) and Phoneme-Grapheme (Ph-G)
        correspondences for a subset of words from the <i>Manulex</i> database
        (approximatively 10,000 words). The latter indexes all the words
        included in a selection of Grade 1 to 5 school textbooks published and
        available in France (Lété, Sprenger-Charolles, &amp; Colé, 2004). The <i>Manulex_morpho</i>
        database indexes 20% of the lexical entries (i.e: the denominator
        reflects each word in the corpus, counted once) in the textbooks, which
        represents more than 90% of the textual entries (i.e:, the denominator
        reflects all the words in the corpus, including their reoccurrence in
        the textbooks). </p>
      <p> Contrary to other databases published (<i>Manulex_infra</i>; Peereman,
        Lété, &amp; Sprenger-Charolles, 2007), <i>Manulex_morpho</i> accounts
        for the morphological structure of written words, which represents its
        most valuable contribution to the field. Four categories of
        morphological markers were used to index graphemes and phonemes in the
        database, mostly located in at the ends of words: 1. Nominal inflections
        marking gender and number; 2. Verbal inflections; 3. Morpho-graphemes
        such as 'ent' in adverbs (rarement, vivement, vraiment); 4 Final
        consonants in a word, which are silent but can be pronounced when
        inflected (for example 'd' in 'grand-grande-grandeur'). </p>
      <p> For each word, the <i>Manulex_morpho</i> database provides the G-Ph
        and Ph-G frequency and consistency depending on their position in words:
        initial (first grapheme/phoneme), final (last grapheme/phoneme), and
        intermediate (graphemes/phonemes in the middle of words). It also
        provides two types of mean consistency and frequency, regardless of
        position in a word: one lexical and the other textual. The lexical
        frequency (i.e. Count by-type) reflects the number of words in the
        database that include a G-Ph and Ph-G correspondences, whereby each word
        is only counted once. Text frequency (i.e. Count by-token) reflects the
        number of words in the texts that include a correspondence of interest,
        whereby a word is strictly counted as often as it appears in the corpus.
        For example, the grapheme ‘ch’ occurs in 562 French words. Among them,
        there are 9 words that include the G-Ph correspondence 'ch' - /k/ as in
        the word 'chorale’; thus the lexical frequency of the correspondence is
        9. The total frequency of occurrences of those 9 words in the corpus of
        text is 184, and this is therefore the textual frequency of ‘ch' - /k/
        correspondence. The most frequent pronunciation of the ‘ch’ grapheme is
        /ʃ/ as in the word ‘cheval’. The correspondence ‘ch’-/ʃ/ occurs in 553
        words and the total frequency of these 553 words is 22,388. The
        consistency of 'ch' - /k/ is therefore fairly low in French. In the
        database, consistency is expressed as a percentage, obtained from the
        ratio of the correspondence’s own frequency over the grapheme’s overall
        frequency. For 'ch' - /k/ lexical consistency is 1.60% (9/[553 + 9]) x
        100 = 1.60%) and textual consistency – derived via the same calculation
        only using textual frequency data – is 0.82% (184/[22,388 + 184]) x 100
        = 0.82%). </p>
