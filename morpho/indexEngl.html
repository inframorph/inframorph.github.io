      <p> <i>Manulex_morpho</i> provides the frequency and the consistency of
        the Grapheme-Phoneme (G-Ph) and Phoneme-Grapheme (Ph-G) correspondences
        of about 10,000 words from the <i>Manulex</i> database <span class="VIiyi"
          lang="en"><span class="JLqJ4b ChMk0b" data-language-for-alternatives="en"
            data-language-to-translate-into="fr" data-phrase-index="0" data-number-of-phrases="1"><span>which
              lists the word frequency values for about 49,000 words present in
              elementary school textbooks</span></span></span>. The selection
        encompasses approximately 20% of the lexical entries in <i>Manulex</i>,
        and more than 90% of the textual entries. </p>
      <p> The main contribution of <i>Manulex_morpho</i> compared to <i>Manulex_infra</i>
        is that the grapho-phonological associations are analyzed separately
        according to whether or not they correspond to morphological markers,
        located essentially at&nbsp; word end. A particular source of
        difficulties in learning to read and write is that nominal inflections
        ('e', 's' and 'x') and verbal inflections ('e', 'es', 'ent'...) are
        often silent in speech. The coding and analysis of morphological marks
        was carried out at the grapho-phonemic level in four cases: nominal
        inflections of gender and number; verbal inflections (e.g., 'er', 'ont',
        'ant', 'ais' but not ir' or 'oir' with more than one phoneme); final
        consonants that may be silent in the root word ('d' of 'grand') but
        heard in the gender inflected and/or derived forms ('grande -
        grandeur'); the final '-ent' of manner adverbs (in '-ment'; 'rarement',
        'vraiment') </p>
      <p> For each word, <i>Manulex_morpho</i> provides the frequency and
        consistency of G-Ph and Ph-G associations as a function of their
        position in words: initial (first G and Ph of the word), final (last G
        and Ph), and intermediate (G and Ph in the middle of words). Frequency
        and consistency of the associations are computed by type (lexical
        frequency) and by token (textual frequency). Lexical frequency (i.e.
        count by-type) reflects the number of words in the database that include
        a G-Ph or Ph-G correspondence of interest while each word is only
        counted once. Textual frequency (i.e. count by-token) reflects the
        number of words in the texts that include a correspondence while each
        word is counted as often as it appears in the corpus. For example, the
        grapheme ‘ch’ appears in 562 French words, including 9 words with 'ch'
        pronounced /k/ ('chorale’) and 553 with 'ch' pronounced /ʃ/ (‘cheval’).
        Consistency is a percentage corresponding to the ratio between the
        frequency of the G-Ph correspondance and the global frequency of the
        grapheme. For the association 'ch' - /k/, the lexical consistency is
        therefore 1.60% (9/[553 + 9]) x 100 = 1.60%). The textual consistency is
        similarly calculated except it uses textual frequency data. Knowing that
        the total frequency is 184 for the 9 words with 'ch' pronounced /k/ and
        22,388 for the 553 words with 'ch' pronounced /ʃ/, the textual
        consistency of the 'ch' - /k/ association is 0.82% (184/[22,388 + 184])
        x 100 = 0.82%).<br>
