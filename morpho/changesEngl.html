        <h1>Major changes in <i>Manulex Morpho version 2<br>
          </i></h1>
      </titrepage>
      <p>Like the Manulex-Infra database, version 2 of Manulex-Morpho brings
        major changes when compared to version 1. Overall, for 35% of the words,
        at least one G-Ph association is modified/corrected in version 2. The
        percentage reaches 47% for Ph-G associations. A significant part of the
        modifications is due to 1) the use of distinct G-Ph and Ph-G
        segmentations, 2) how positional coding of the associations is realized
        (initial, final or internal association of the word), and 3) the coding
        of Ph-G consistency when silent graphemes correspond to gender/number
        inflections or derivation/gender inflection supports (e.g., the final
        't' in 'petit' because ' petite', the final 'd' in 'bavard' because
        'bavarde', see 'morphology codes' tab).<br>
        <br>
        • G-Ph and Ph-G segmentations are different. In version 1 of
        Manulex_Morpho, the description of grapheme-phoneme associations was
        initially thought in the "reading direction", from grapheme to phoneme.
        The same associations were used to analyze the associations between
        phoneme and grapheme (writing direction). However, this leads to some
        problems when estimating consistencies, especially -but not exclusively-
        when the words include final silent letters. For example, the G-Ph final
        association of the word "nid" ending in a silent "d" is very consistent
        because the "d" is rarely pronounced at the end of words. Conversely,
        the final 'd' of the word 'sud' is pronounced, and the consistency of
        the association between the grapheme 'd' and the phoneme /d/ is low. The
        presence of silent letters at the end of words must be considered
        differently in the analysis of the associations between phonemes and
        graphemes since, by definition, silent graphemes have no counterpart in
        the speech signal. (e.g. the phonemic sequence /fulaR/ for the word
        'foulard' whose final 'd' is silent). The solution adopted in
        Manulex_Morpho v.2 to describe the Ph-G associations is to group the
        silent letters with the grapheme corresponding to the last pronounced
        phoneme. For example, in the writing direction, the word 'renard' is
        coded with /R/-rd, the word 'terre' is coded with /R/-rre, and the word
        'gare' is coded with /R/-re (the pronunciation of 'renard' is thus
        compatible with the spelling errors '*renarre', or '*renare'). The
        coding principle is similar when the last phoneme is a vowel; 'dans' is
        coded with /ã/-ans, and 'étang' with /ã/-ang. <br>
        <br>
        • Positional coding of associations. 1) Gender inflections, whether or
        not followed by a number inflection, are coded as final graphemes. 2)
        Similarly, verbal inflections are coded as final graphemes, whether or
        not they are followed by a gender or number inflection (e.g. the final
        -ées of plural feminine past participles). However, the -ant, -it, -is,
        and -t inflections of present and past participles are coded as internal
        when followed by a gender inflection because the latter modifies the
        pronunciation of the final consonant (-t or –s of the verbal
        inflection). This exception is necessary to preserve the consistency of
        pronunciations of verbal inflections (e.g., -ant in 'glissant' and in
        'glissante'). 3) Other graphemes (consonants and vowels) not followed by
        a vowel (gender inflection 'e' or not) but followed by a number
        inflection are coded as final (e.g. The final ‘d’ in ‘bavard’ and in
        ‘buvard’ is also coded as final when these words are in the plural form
        (‘bavards’, ‘buvards’)). This ensures the same treatment of these
        consonants/vowels depending on whether the word is singular or plural. <br>
        <br>
        • Ph-G consistency when silent graphemes correspond to gender/number
        inflections or derivation/flexion supports. Gender/number inflections
        are tagged with the number '3' and derivation/flexion supports are
        tagged with the number '6' (see the 'morphology codes' tab). The
        consistency of Ph-G associations for gender/number inflections is set to
        100% since the probability that the word ends with 'e' is 100% if the
        word is gender inflected, and the probability that the word ends with
        's' or 'x' is 100% if the word is number inflected. The consistency of
        derivation/flexion supports corresponding to silent consonants (e.g.,
        't' in 'aliment', 'd' in 'grand') is also set to 100% since the silent
        grapheme can be predicted from the derived words ('alimentation',
        'alimentaire', ‘grandeur’) or the inflected words ('grande'). Predicting
        the silent graphemes is generally straightforward for endings in -b
        (plomb), -d (grand), -g (long, sang), -l (cristal, gentil), -p (camp),
        -t (absent) even though the pronunciation of the grapheme may differ
        between derived/inflected forms (e.g., 'g' pronounced /g/ in 'longueur'
        and /ʒ/ in 'longer'). Graphemes in -f are transformed into /v/ during
        derivations/flexions (sportif - sportive, neuf - neuve), but the
        presence of a -v in word endings is graphotactically illegal in French.
        Finally, endings in –c (blanc, banc), -s (gros, gris, frais), -x (choix,
        doux), and -z (riz) are associated with more than one phoneme in
        derived/inflected forms (/s/, /z/, /S/, /k/) and Ph-G consistency is
        therefore estimated according to the probability of each of the possible
        silent graphemes. For example, the /z/ in 'choisir' (/SwaziR/) is
        compatible with 'x' in the word 'choix', but 's' (*chois) or 'z'
        (*choiz) are also possible because /z/ can occur in derived/inflected
        forms of words ending in –z or –s (riz-rizière, gris-grise). <br>
        <br>
        • For each word, the least consistent G-Ph or Ph-G association, and of
        the least frequent association are mentioned to facilitate word
        selection. Note that the least consistent association is not necessarily
        the least frequent association, and vice-versa. <br>
        <br>
        • Modifications/corrections of several phonological codes, graphemic and
        phonological segmentations<br>
        <br>
        • Removal of the distinction between the two 'a's (/a/ of 'patte' and
        /ɑ/ of 'pâte') when computing G-Ph consistency<br>
        <br>
        • Words including the grapheme 'ai' (e. g., 'maison', 'lainage') can
        frequently be pronounced with the phoneme /E/ or the phoneme /e/. The
        consistency of the G-Ph association no longer takes this distinction
        into account. <br>
        <br>
        • Introduction of the distinctions between the 'e' grapheme when
        obligatorily pronounced (compulsory schwa), always silent, or
        corresponding to an optional schwa (see 'phonetic codes' tab) <br>
        <br>
        • The G-Ph consistency for 'e' with optional schwa ('reste', 'perle') is
        set to 100 since the 'e' may or may not be pronounced. <br>
        <br>
        • In the case of Ph-G associations, the silent letters in internal
        position (e.g. 'm' in 'autumn', 'p' in 'baptism') are not predictable
        from the speech signal, and the Ph-G consistency is therefore set to
        zero<br>
        <br>
        • Case of 'e' followed by two identical consonants. The coding, in the
        reading direction (G-Ph), is standardized by coding the 'e' followed by
        two identical consonants as ‘e[CC]’ (with 'CC' meaning 2 identical
        consonants). For exemple, the word 'femme' is coded as 'f.e[CC].mm.e'.
        Its low consistency value results from the fact that 'e' followed by a
        doublet is usually pronounced /e/ or /E/. This particular coding is only
        realized for G-Ph associations, not for Ph-G associations since, in
        French, the presence of a doublet is not indicated in the speech signal.
        The coding of G-Ph associations with 'e[CC]' applies to all words in
        order to highlight inconsistencies (thus also to words such as 'ennui'
        coded 'e[CC]-@.nn-n.ui-8i') <br>
        <br>
        • Case of words including -eill or -eil not preceded by 'u' (e. g.,
        'abeille', 'bienveillant', 'sommeil'). The coding has been modified in
        'eil' or 'eill'. In these groups the sequence 'ill' is always associated
        with the semi-vowel /j/, never with the consonant /l/<br>
        <br>
        • In order to eliminate some rare G-Ph or Ph-G associations, proper
        names are excluded from the analyses <br>
