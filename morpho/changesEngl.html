        <h1>Main changes in <i>Manulex Morpho ver.2<br>
          </i></h1>
      </titrepage>
      <p>Manulex-Morpho Version 2 brings major changes to version 1. Changes are
        mostly the result of differences in (a) the segmentations of G-Ph and
        Ph-G, (b) the positional coding of the associations (initial, final or
        internal association), and (c) the coding of Ph-G consistency when
        silent graphemes correspond to nominal inflections (gender or number),
        as well as to derivational / gender inflectional supports (e.g., the
        final 't' in 'petit' vs. 'petite', the 'd' in 'bavard' vs. 'bavarde',
        see 'morphology codes' tab).<br>
        <br>
        • G-Ph (reading direction) and Ph-G (writing direction) segmentations
        are different. In version 1 of Manulex_Morpho, associations were
        conceived to reflect reading processes, from grapheme to phoneme. We
        used the same associations to reflect writing from phoneme and grapheme.
        This lead to problems in calculating consistency, notably when words
        include final silent letters. For example, the word&nbsp; 'nid' ends
        with a silent 'd'. The G-Ph association on the final grapheme is highly
        consistent because final 'd' in most words is silent. By contrast, the
        final 'd' of the word 'sud' is pronounced, therefore the consistency of
        this association (grapheme 'd' associated with the phoneme /d/) in word
        final position is low. When considering writing, Ph-G associations for
        word final silent letters are difficult to predict, because they are not
        pronounced. The solution adopted in Manulex_Morpho v.2 is to combine
        them with the last pronounced phoneme. For example, the word 'renard’
        ends in /R/ which is associated to the spelling '-rd', and the final
        phoneme /R/ in 'gare' and 'terre' are associated to&nbsp; '-re' and
        '-rre', respectively. The pronunciation of 'renard' is thus compatible
        with the invented spelling errors '*renarre', or '*renare'). The same
        coding principle applies to silent letters that follow vowels;&nbsp;
        'dans' is coded with /ã/-ans, and 'étang' with /ã/-ang. <br>
        <br>
        • Positional coding of associations. 1) Noun gender inflections are
        coded as final graphemes whether or not they are followed by a number
        inflection. 2) Similarly, verbal inflections are coded as final
        graphemes, whether or not they are followed by a gender or number
        inflection (e.g. the final -ées of plural feminine past participles).
        However, the verbal inflections -ant, -it, -is, and -t which mark the
        present and past participles, are coded as internal when followed by a
        gender inflection.The inflection modifies the pronunciation of the final
        consonant of the verbal inflection (t, s) and places them in internal
        position within the word. This exception is necessary to preserve the
        consistency of pronunciations for verbal inflections (e.g., -ant in
        'glissant' and in 'glissante'). 3) In order to process consonants and
        vowels the same way whether the word is singular or plural, graphemes
        followed by a nominal number inflection are coded as final as in: the
        final ‘d’ in bavards' or 'renards'; the final 'et' in 'bouquets', and
        the final 'a' in 'caméras'. This does not apply when graphemes are
        followed by a vowel (as in the nominal gender inflection 'e'). <br>
        <br>
        • Ph-G consistency (writing direction) when silent graphemes correspond
        to nominal inflections (gender or number) or derivation/flexion
        supports: nominal inflections are indicated with code '3' and
        derivation/flexion supports with code '6' (see tab 'morphological
        codes'). The consistency of the Ph-G associations for nominal
        inflections is established at 100% since the probability that the word
        ends with an 'e' is 100% if the word is gender inflected, and the
        probability that the word ends in 's' or 'x' is 100% if the word is
        number inflected. The consistency of derivation/flexion supports for
        silent consonants (e.g., 't' in ‘aliment’, 'd' in ‘grand') is also 100%
        since the silent grapheme can be guessed based on derived words
        ('alimentation', 'alimentaire', 'grande') or the inflected words
        ('aliment’, ‘grand’). Guessing a silent grapheme is generally
        straightforward for endings in -b (plomb), -d (grand), -g (long, sang),
        -l (cristal, gentil), -p (camp), -t (absent) even though the
        pronunciation of the grapheme may differ between derived/inflected forms
        (e.g., 'g' pronounced /g/ in 'longueur' and /ʒ/ in 'longer'). As for the
        final -f, they are changed into /v/ during derivations/flexions (sportif
        - sportive, neuf - neuve), as the presence of a -v in word finals is
        phonotactically illegal in French. Final&nbsp; -s (gros, gris, frais),
        in -x (choix, doux), and -z (riz) are associated with the phonemes /s/,
        /z/, /S/ and the Ph-G consistencies are thus estimated according to the
        probability of each of the silent grapheme from the phoneme. For
        exemple, the /z/ in 'choisir' /SwaziR/ is compatible with 'x' in the
        word 'choix', but 's' (*chois) or 'z' (*choiz) are also possible because
        /z/ can occur in derived/inflected forms of words ending in –z or –s
        (riz-rizière, gris-grise). <br>
        <br>
        • For each word, the database provides the least consistent G-Ph or Ph-G
        association, and of the least frequent association. Note that the least
        consistent association is not necessarily the least frequent, and
        vice-versa. <br>
        <br>
        • Modifications and corrections of several phonological codes and
        segmentations into graphemes and phonemes<br>
        <br>
        • The distinction between the two 'a' (/a/ of 'patte' and /ɑ/ of 'pâte')
        were removed from consistency calculation. They are considered as the
        same phoneme.<br>
        <br>
        • Words including the grapheme 'ai' ('maison', 'laine') can be
        transcribed with /E/ or /e/. Therefore consistency calculation consider
        the G-Ph association as the same. <br>
        <br>
        • Introduction of differences between always pronounced, always silent,
        and optional 'e' (see 'phonetic codes' tab) <br>
        <br>
        • The G-Ph consistency for the grapheme 'e' whose schwa is optional
        ('gare', 'parle') is set to 100 since the 'e' may or may not be
        pronounced. <br>
        <br>
        • In the case of Ph-G associations only, the few rare silent consonants
        in internal position (e.g. 'm' in 'automne', 'p' in 'baptême') are not
        present in the speech signal, and their Ph-G consistency is therefore
        0%.<br>
        <br>
        • Cases where 'e' is followed by two identical consonants. The coding
        for G-Ph associations, was standardized by sorting 'e' when followed by
        two identical consonants as .e[CC]. (with CC to indicate 2 identical
        consonants) For exemple, the word 'femme' is now coded as
        'f.e[CC].mm.e'. This change in coding now describes the word 'femme'
        with a low consistency score because 'e' followed by a doublet is
        usually pronounced /e/ or /E/. However, this only happens when the 'e'
        is not included in a morphologically coded group (subscript '6';
        derivation/flexion support) such as in 'ancienne' where 'enn' is coded
        '6enn'. This coding of 'e[CC]' is only done for G-Ph associations but
        not for Ph-G associations since, in spoken French, double consonants are
        not distinguishable from single consonants. The coding of G-Ph
        associations with 'e[CC]' applies to all words in order to highlight
        inconsistencies (thus also to words such as 'ennui' coded
        'e[CC]-@.nn-n.ui-8i') <br>
        <br>
        • Coding has been modified when -eill or -eil are not preceded by 'u'
        ('abeille', 'bienveillant', 'sommeil'). 'eil' and 'eill' are not a
        single block where 'ill' is always associated with the semi-vowel /j/,
        never with the consonant /l/.<br>
        <br>
        • In order to eliminate some rare G-Ph or Ph-G associations, proper
        names are excluded from the analyses <br>
        <br>
        • The phonological structure CV and identification of consonant clusters
        have been added.<br>
