                <h1>Main changes in <i>Manulex Morpho ver.2<br>
                  </i></h1>
              </titrepage>
              <p>Manulex-Morpho Version 2 brings major changes to version 1.
                Changes are mostly the result of differences in (a) the
                segmentations of G-Ph and Ph-G, (b) the positional coding of the
                associations (initial, final or internal association), and (c)
                the coding of Ph-G consistency when silent graphemes correspond
                to nominal inflections (gender or number), as well as to
                derivational / gender inflectional supports (e.g., the final 't'
                in 'petit' vs. 'petite', the 'd' in 'bavard' vs. 'bavarde', see
                'morphology codes' tab).<br>
                <br>
                • G-Ph (reading direction) and Ph-G (writing direction)
                segmentations are different. In version 1 of Manulex_Morpho,
                associations were conceived to reflect reading processes, from
                grapheme to phoneme. We used the same associations to reflect
                writing from phoneme and grapheme. This lead to problems in
                calculating consistency, notably when words include final silent
                letters. For example, the word&nbsp; 'nid' ends with a silent
                'd'. The G-Ph association on the final grapheme is highly
                consistent because final 'd' in most words is silent. By
                contrast, the final 'd' of the word 'sud' is pronounced,
                therefore the consistency of this association (grapheme 'd'
                associated with the phoneme /d/) in word final position is low.
                When considering writing, Ph-G associations for word final
                silent letters are difficult to predict, because they are not
                pronounced. The solution adopted in Manulex_Morpho v.2 is to
                combine them with the last pronounced phoneme. For example, the
                word 'renard’ ends in /R/ which is associated to the spelling
                '-rd', and the final phoneme /R/ in 'gare' and 'terre' are
                associated to&nbsp; '-re' and '-rre', respectively. The
                pronunciation of 'renard' is thus compatible with the invented
                spelling errors '*renarre', or '*renare'). The same coding
                principle applies to silent letters that follow vowels;&nbsp;
                'dans' is coded with /ã/-ans, and 'étang' with /ã/-ang. <br>
                <br>
                • Positional coding of associations. 1) Noun gender inflections
                are coded as final graphemes whether or not they are followed by
                a number inflection. 2) Similarly, verbal inflections are coded
                as final graphemes, whether or not they are followed by a gender
                or number inflection (e.g. the final -ées of plural feminine
                past participles). However, the verbal inflections -ant, -it,
                -is, and -t which mark the present and past participles, are
                coded as internal when followed by a gender inflection.The
                inflection modifies the pronunciation of the final consonant of
                the verbal inflection (t, s) and places them in internal
                position within the word. This exception is necessary to
                preserve the consistency of pronunciations for verbal
                inflections (e.g., -ant in 'glissant' and in 'glissante'). 3) In
                order to process consonants and vowels the same way whether the
                word is singular or plural, graphemes followed by a nominal
                number inflection are coded as final as in: the final ‘d’ in
                bavards' or 'renards'; the final 'et' in 'bouquets', and the
                final 'a' in 'caméras'. This does not apply when graphemes are
                followed by a vowel (as in the nominal gender inflection 'e'). <br>
                <br>
                • Ph-G consistency (writing direction) when silent graphemes
                correspond to nominal inflections (gender or number) or
                derivation/flexion supports: nominal inflections are indicated
                with code '3' and derivation/flexion supports with code '6' (see
                tab 'morphological codes'). The consistency of the Ph-G
                associations for nominal inflections is established at 100%
                since the probability that the word ends with an 'e' is 100% if
                the word is gender inflected, and the probability that the word
                ends in 's' or 'x' is 100% if the word is number inflected. The
                consistency of derivation/flexion supports for silent consonants
                (e.g., 't' in ‘aliment’, 'd' in ‘grand') is also 100% since the
                silent grapheme can be guessed based on derived words
                ('alimentation', 'alimentaire', 'grandeur') or inflected words
                (‘grande’). Guessing a silent grapheme is generally
                straightforward for endings in -b (plomb), -d (grand), -g (long,
                sang), -l (cristal, gentil), -p (camp), -t (absent) even though
                the pronunciation of the grapheme may differ between
                derived/inflected forms (e.g., 'g' pronounced /g/ in 'longueur'
                and /ʒ/ in 'longer'). As for the final -f, they are changed into
                /v/ during derivations/flexions (sportif - sportive, neuf -
                neuve), as the presence of a -v in word finals is
                phonotactically illegal in French. Final&nbsp; -s (gros, gris,
                frais), in -x (choix, doux), and -z (riz) are associated with
                the phonemes /s/, /z/, /S/ and the Ph-G consistencies are thus
                estimated according to the probability of each of the silent
                grapheme from the phoneme. For exemple, the /z/ in 'choisir'
                /SwaziR/ is compatible with 'x' in the word 'choix', but 's'
                (*chois) or 'z' (*choiz) are also possible because /z/ can occur
                in derived/inflected forms of words ending in –z or –s
                (riz-rizière, gris-grise). <br>
                <br>
                • For each word, the database provides the least consistent G-Ph
                or Ph-G association, and the least frequent association. Note
                that the least consistent association is not necessarily the
                least frequent, and vice-versa. <br>
                <br>
                • Modifications and corrections of several phonological codes
                and segmentations into graphemes and phonemes<br>
                <br>
                • The distinction between the two 'a' (/a/ of 'patte' and /ɑ/ of
                'pâte') is removed from consistency calculation. They are
                considered as the same phoneme.<br>
                <br>
                • Words including the grapheme 'ai' ('maison', 'laine') can be
                transcribed with /E/ or /e/. Therefore consistency calculation
                consider the G-Ph association as the same. <br>
                <br>
                • Introduction of differences between always pronounced, always
                silent, and optional 'e' (see 'phonetic codes' tab) <br>
                <br>
                • The G-Ph consistency for the grapheme 'e' whose schwa is
                optional ('gare', 'parle') is set to 100 since the 'e' may or
                may not be pronounced. <br>
                <br>
                • In the case of Ph-G associations only, the few rare silent
                consonants in internal position (e.g. 'm' in 'automne', 'p' in
                'baptême') are not present in the speech signal, and their Ph-G
                consistency is therefore 0%.<br>
                <br>
                • Cases where 'e' is followed by two identical consonants. The
                coding for G-Ph associations, was standardized by sorting 'e'
                when followed by two identical consonants as .e[CC]. (with CC to
                indicate 2 identical consonants). For exemple, the word 'femme'
                is now coded as 'f.e[CC].mm.e'. This change in coding now
                describes the word 'femme' with a low consistency score because
                'e' followed by a doublet is usually pronounced /e/ or /E/.
                However, this only happens when the 'e' is not included in a
                morphologically coded group (subscript '6'; derivation/flexion
                support) such as in 'ancienne' where 'enn' is coded '6enn'. This
                coding of 'e[CC]' is only done for G-Ph associations but not for
                Ph-G associations since, in spoken French, double consonants are
                not distinguishable from single consonants. The coding of G-Ph
                associations with 'e[CC]' applies to all words in order to
                highlight inconsistencies (thus also to words such as 'ennui'
                coded 'e[CC]-@.nn-n.ui-8i') <br>
                <br>
                • Coding has been modified when -eill or -eil are not preceded
                by 'u' ('abeille', 'bienveillant', 'sommeil'). 'eil' and 'eill'
                are now single blocks where 'il' or 'ill' are always associated
                with the semi-vowel /j/, never with the consonant /l/.<br>
                <br>
                • In order to eliminate some rare G-Ph or Ph-G associations,
                proper names are excluded from the analyses <br>
                <br>
                • The phonological structure CV and identification of consonant
                clusters have been added.<br>
